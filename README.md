# Budget-Tracker

This Project is designed to take showcase a budget tracking app that can function in an offline environment. 

- Allows user to enter budget input and stores it in a Mongo Database.
- When a database connection fails, the application will store the record in IndexDB.
- When the page is loaded and a network connection is established, all indexed records will be added to the Database.
